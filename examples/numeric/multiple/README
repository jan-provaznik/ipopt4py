         Example: a simple objective function with multiple constraits

Problem statement

  minimize
    sqrt((x - 1) ** 2 + (y - 1) ** 2)
  subject to
    sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2) <= 5
    x + y >= 3
  with (x, y) bound to
    0 < x < 5
    0 < y < 5

Examples

  Numerically computed gradient and jacobi matrices.

Notes

  Why it gets lost and runs into the bounds is currently beyond me.
